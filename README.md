# CNN-Mnist-99.2
The goal was to modify the CNN hyperparameters and test it on the Mnist dataset in order to achieve the highest accuracy

Theoretically the CNN model should work better with the image dataset but I was not able able to achieve a higher accuracy with the a basic CNN network[question 1].This is due to the fact that there are very few hidden layers defined and hence they cannot properly predict the output since this dataset is very large in size.CNN can be intricately designed with lots of hyperparameters to suit a dataset with higher number of samples to produce a high accuracy. In the latter part of the project, I was able to design a CNN model with an accuracy of >99.2%
